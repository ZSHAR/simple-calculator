# simple-calculator

Project Name: Simple Calculator

Description:
This project is a Python script that serves as a simple calculator. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on a set of numbers. Users input the number of values they want to operate on and then enter those values. The script then provides a menu for selecting the desired arithmetic operation and displays the result.

Key Components:

Math Functions: Four functions (add, subtract, multiply, divide) perform basic arithmetic operations on a list of numbers.

User Input: The script prompts the user to input:

The number of values they want to operate on (n).
The values themselves, one by one.
Menu and Operation Selection: The script displays a menu with options for different arithmetic operations.

Users select an operation by entering a numeric choice (1 for addition, 2 for subtraction, etc.).
Calculation and Result: The script performs the selected operation on the user-provided numbers and displays the result.

Summary:
This project is a basic calculator that can perform simple arithmetic operations on a set of user-provided numbers. It provides a menu-driven interface for ease of use and is suitable for quick calculations. Users can input the number of values they want to work with and choose the operation they wish to perform, making it a versatile tool for basic mathematical tasks.
